# Filtr [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/logicalparadox/filtr.png)](http://travis-ci.org/logicalparadox/filtr)

Filter javascript arrays using a MongoDB style syntax and is available for node.js
and the browser. It was originally written as an internal component for [Seed](https://github.com/qualiancy/seed),
but it had no other dependancies and seemed fit for use in the browser.

## Installation

### Node.js

Filtr is available on npm.

    npm install filtr

### Browser

A browser build is available in the repository's `dist` folder.
Download the package and include either the normal or minimized build in your HTML header.

    <script src="filtr.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="filtr.min.js" type="text.javascript"></script>

The browser build is fully AMD and CommonJS compatible and should work on all browser.

## Features

Filtr is still in early development so expect this list to grow.

##### Expansive Query Language

* Comparators: `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`, `$all`, `$exists`, `$mod`, `$eq`, `$ne`, `$in`, `$nin`, `$size`, `$regex`
* Traversables: `$or`, `$nor`, `$and`

##### Data Helpers

* `filtr.getPathValue` returns the nested value in an object given a string path
* `filtr.setPathValue` sets the nested value in an object given a string path
* `filtr.comparators` are available directly for quick value testing

### Usage

```js
var query = filtr({ $gt: 15, $lt: 25 })
  , results = query.test([ 5, 10, 17, 19, 25 ]);
// results == [ 17, 19 ];
```

#### Test options provide different output 

Testing also supports a number of options passed in as the second argument.

* **spec**: output modifer
  * _subset_: (default) return an array containing a subset of matched items
  * _boolean_: return an array of the original length with each item being a boolean when object passed or failed.
  * _index_: return an array of numbers matching the index of passed object in the original array
* **type**: input modifier
  * _set_: (default) assert that the data provided is an array. test each item.
  * _single_: assert that the data provided is a single item. return boolean.

Using the `spec` output modifier is an easy way to handle post processing of result sets
without having to match up a subset.

```js
var query = filtr({ $gt: 15, $lt: 25 })
  , results = query.test([ 5, 10, 17, 19, 25 ], { spec: 'boolean' });
// results == [ false, false, true, true, false ];
```

#### Using paths for deep matching

Filtr also supports using paths for deep matching within a javascript object. Given the 
following items, and sample queries.

```js
var dataComplex = [
    { a: { b: 100 }
    , c: 'testC'
    , d: 
      [ { e: 'world' } ] 
    }
  , { a: { b: 50 }
    , c: 'testC'
    , d: 
      [ { e: 'universe' }
      , { e: 'galaxy' } ]
    }
];

var query1 = filtr({ 'a.b': { $gt: 75, $lt: 125 } });
  , query2 = filtr({ 'a.b': { $gt: 25, $lt: 75 }, 'd[0].e': { $eq: 'universe' } });

var res1 = query1.test(dataComplex)  // result would have the first item
  , res2 = query1.test(dataComplex); // result would have the second item 
```

A helper is also available that returns the value in a nested object given a string path.

```js
var hello = filtr.getPathValue('d[0].e', dataComplex[1]);
// hello == 'universe'
```

## Where to Get Help

Please post issues to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/logicalparadox/filtr/issues).

## Tests

Tests are written in the BDD styles for the [Mocha]() test runner using the
`should` assertion interface from [Chai](http://chaijs.com). Running tests is simple:

    make test

A browser suite is also available at `test/browser/index.js`. The same test definitions are 
used in both contexts.
